AP CSA Group Create A Application Project <br />
This repository will contain a Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game that incorporates fighting aspects <br />

  Possible BackStory: <br />

  In the distant future, the world has been taken over by dancing robots. You are one of the few humans left in the world <br />
  that went into hiding following the robotic takeover. Your goal is to challenge these robots to fights and win.  <br />
  Luckily, these robots allow their challengers to pick the beats, difficulty, and song, giving you the upperhand. <br />
  Don't let this advantage go to waste! You are one of the last hopes that humanity have to survive!

# Planning:

  For each map object, it will have a method that will read a certain text file for the moves. <br />
  
  VERSION 1 <br />
  "Song Name", BPM, Some integer for difficulty <br />
  "Column that the move will appear in", Some integer representing timeframe <br />

  Example: <br />
  "Counting Stars", 10, 1 - 1 for HARD <br />
  "LEFT", 10 - 10 for ms <br />
  
  <b> VERSION 2 AND THE FINAL VERSION </b> <br />
  
  Title: Hitroigoto <br />
  BPM: 165 <br />
  Arist: ClariS <br />
  Offset: 0 <br />

  0,0,1 - First number represents which lane the stroke spawns in, the second number represents when the stroke spawns, <br />
  and the last number represents how long the stroke should be held for since start of the game (NOT THE ACTUAL PRESS ITSELF)<br />
  
  <b> Interface Planning </b> <br /> 

  Instead of having placeholders per accuracy calculation, create a interface for STEVEN to implement <br /> 
  that contains methods to determine the accuracy based on the specified parameters. <br />
  
  determineAccuracy(stroke); <br />
  
  Determine accuracy takes in a stroke and then utilizes the properties of the stroke and current game properties to <br /> 
  to determine whether or not the player made a PERFECT, GREAT, GOOD, OKAY, or MISS stroke. <br />
  
  playerMiss(); <br />
  
  This method is called when the program already knows that the player missed without making the calculations in the other <br />
  accuracy method. Perform the calculations with the score and possibly update it on the screen. <br />
  
  Resizable Game Planning: <br /> 

  Make the constants private as the window properties may be subjected to change per game...? <br />
