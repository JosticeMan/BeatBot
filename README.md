  Possible BackStory: <br />

  In the distant future, the world has been taken over by dancing robots. You are one of the few humans left in the world <br />
  that went into hiding following the robotic takeover. Your goal is to challenge these robots to fights and win.  <br />
  Luckily, these robots allow their challengers to pick the beats, difficulty, and song, giving you the upperhand. <br />
  Don't let this advantage go to waste! You are one of the last hopes that humanity have to survive!

# Planning:

  For each map object, it will have a method that will read a certain text file for the moves. <br />
  Perhaps the text file will be formatted by like: <br />
  "Song Name", BPM, Some integer for difficulty
  "Column that the move will appear in", Some integer representing timeframe
  
  Example: <br />
  "Counting Stars", 10, 1 - 1 for HARD <br />
  "LEFT", 10 - 10 for ms <br />
